# AJIO-Data-analysis
This project is an *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* of AJIOâ€™s customer, order, transaction, and other operational datasets using Python and Pandas.

##  Datasets Used
- customers.csv: Customer details (name, age, gender, address)
- orders.csv: Order details (quantities, IDs)
- transactions.csv: Transaction summary (amounts, dates)
- delivery.csv: Delivery logs
- products.csv: Product catalog
- returns.csv: Return information
- ratings.csv: Customer feedback

##  Key Explorations
- Customer demographics and distribution by state
- Order volume and duplicate detection
- Missing value handling using median and forward fill
- Transaction insights using .describe() and .head()
- State-wise order aggregation with groupby
- Merging orders and customers for unified insights

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (optional, for visualizations)

## Future Improvements
- EDA for delivery, returns, ratings, and products
- Visualizations: bar charts, heatmaps, pie charts
- Customer segmentation based on age, order behavior
- Product-level insights

## Outcome
This project helps understand customer and order behavior for an e-commerce company. It shows hands-on skills in data cleaning, aggregation, and merging multi-table datasets using Pandas.
